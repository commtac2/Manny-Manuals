# What is Multi-Factor Authentication

The General Model is having two things,

1. Something You Know
2. Something You Have

"Something You Know" is going to be your Password, or a PIN you have memorized or written down somewhere.

For "Something You Have", companies have been using biometric
identifiers such as Fingerprints, and Faces to generate PassKeys.

I'm not saying this is right or wrong but smartcards offer a physical means
of providing "something you know", that doesn't necessarily involve handing
over biometric data to Company XYZ Dragon Cannon. 

A YubiKey is one such little USB Smartcard that supports multiple authentication
protocols like FIDO, OpenPGP, Time Based One-Time Passwords,
and PIV (Personal Identity Verification).
